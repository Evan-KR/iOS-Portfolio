## INTRODUCTION 
Hello! My name is Evan Ristani, and I'm currently a senior at EPHS. My main interest in computer science is the opportunity it offers to combine my other passions for art, animation, and music together to create new forms of media. 

## Projects 

**WINTER 2020 - SPRING 2021**

First Fantasy - a turnbased action RPG game 

This app was created within my AP CSP class, using basic block code in order to make a final product. Though the app itself is incomplete, I am happy with the progress I was able to make within such a limited platform. I developed a system where the player could use multiple different items and attacks against an enemy. Each different attack and item would have different properies. Some attacks would do more damage to the enemies armor stat, allowing for more damage to be dealt with other attacks. 
Though this system was still very flawed and needed to be balanced out more, I still believe it makes for an enjoyable, if not limited, experiece.

**WINTER 2021 - SPRING 2022**

OH THE HORROR - Placeholder name 
  
This game is an experimental ClickerGame with eldritch horror-like themes and elements. 
 
Throughout the development, I have learned a lot about app creation, time management, and team coordination. 
Additionally, I have learned how to set realistic epxectations for myself and for my team, allowing us to make the best product we could. 
 
Some notable achievements I have made during the course of the games development so far are:
* Developed a theme & create an (incomplete) soundtrack to compliment the games main theme 
* Learned how to use timers as well as element objects within SwiftUI to update 
* Learned how to impliment views to help organize my code
* Learned how to develop a basic UI 

Other features are still in development, such as:
* Ability to store data persistantly 
* Add points for time app is not running 
* Implimenting UI elements and assets 
* Adding a story with interactive elements based upon the gameplay

## MISC Accomlishments 
Outside of computer science I have had a passion for music and art. Below are a few examples of songs I have worked on in the past. Though they aren't complete, I am still proud of how they turned out.

**FALL 2021**

Besides music, I also have a limited amount of experience with art and drawing. Below is an example of my work.
