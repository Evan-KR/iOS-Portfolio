## INTRODUCTION 
Hello! My name is Evan Krelando Ristani, and I'm a graduate from Eden Prairie High School, and I'm currently enrolled to the University of Minnesota School of Liberal Arts, majoring in Computer Science. My main interest in computer science is the opportunity it offers to combine my other passions for art, animation, and music together to create new forms of media. 

# Computer Science Projects 

**WINTER 2020 - SPRING 2021**

## First Fantasy - a turn based action RPG game 

This app was created within my AP CSP class, using basic block code in order to make a final product. Though the app itself is incomplete, I am happy with the progress I was able to make within such a limited platform. I developed a system where the player could use multiple different items and attacks against an enemy. Each different attack and item would have different properties. Some attacks would do more damage to the enemies armor stat, allowing for more damage to be dealt with other attacks. 
Though this system was still very flawed and needed to be balanced out more, I still believe it makes for an enjoyable, if not limited, experience.

**WINTER 2021 - SPRING 2022**

## [OH THE HORROR - Clicker Game](https://github.com/EvanRista/OhTheHorror)  
This game is an experimental Clicker-Game with eldritch horror-like themes and elements. 
 
Throughout the development, I have learned a lot about app creation, time management, and team coordination. 
Additionally, I have learned how to set realistic expectations for myself and for my team, allowing us to make the best product we could. 
 
Some notable achievements I have made during the games' development so far are:
* Developed a theme & create an (incomplete) soundtrack to compliment the games main theme 
* Learned how to use timers as well as element objects within SwiftUI to update 
* Learned how to implement views to help organize my code
* Learned how to develop a basic UI 

Other features are still in development, such as:
* Ability to store data persistently  
* Add points for time app is not running 
* Implementing UI elements and assets 
* Adding a story with interactive elements based upon the gameplay

**SPRING 2022 - SUMMER 2022**

## [Crusader Dungeon - Dungeon Crawler](https://github.com/EvanRista/Crusader-Dungeon)
My plan for this game was to be a turn based dungeon crawler/rogue-like, similar to Binding Of Isaac, and other games in that genre. 

Throughout the development of the game, I learned how to set realistic goals for myself. At the beginning of the development I had ambitious plans for my project. As time went on though, I came to realize that I could not implement every feature I wanted by myself. As a result, I had to focus on the main gameplay features before working on extra "fluff" and content. 

The main things learned from the development of the app include:
* Learning how to develop a good-looking UI and making it intuitive to use 
* Automatically scaling the UI based on the device screen size 
* Generate levels with a range of heights and widths
* Create an array of interact-able objects
* How to display useful information to the player
* Basic path-finding 

Through the short time I spent working on the app, I believe I was able to accomplish a lot. The app is further along in development compared to Oh The Horror, and is in a fairly stable state though most of the features are not fully implimented. 

If I were to continue working on the app, I would like to add a number of features, including; 
* interact-able map that displays the player's location, as well as location of rooms not yet explored by the player 
* Number of different enemy types that interact with the environment and player differently
* Improved path-finding
* Interactions between the player and AI enemies. 
* Items and abilities for the player to utilize 
* Obstacles

Overall, I am proud of the progress I have made over the short development period.

**FALL 2021 - WINTER 2021**

## [Advent of Code](https://github.com/EvanRista/AdventJava)
Outside of app development, I also have experience with Java. Throughout my time with the language, I have learned how to manipulate and use different data types in order to achieve a desired result. This may be sorting through an array of data in order to find a pattern within, or just making the data more readable and understandable based on inputted values. 

# MISC Accomplishments 
Outside of computer science I have had a passion for music and art. Below are a few examples of songs I have worked on in the past. Though they aren't complete, I am still proud of how they turned out. (Please note, visuals are not mine)

**FALL 2021**

Besides music, I also have a limited amount of experience with art and drawing. Below is an example of my work.
