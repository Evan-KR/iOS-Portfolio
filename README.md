## INTRODUCTION 
Hello! My name is Evan Ristani, and I'm currently a senior at EPHS. My main interest in computer science is the opportunity it offers to combine my other passions for art, animation, and music together to create new forms of media.

OH THE HORROR - Placeholder name 
  
This game is an experimental ClickerGame with eldritch horror-like themes and elements. 
 
Throughout the development, I have learned a lot about app creation, time management, and team coordination. 
Additionally, I have learned how to set realistic epxectations for myself and for my team, allowing us to make the best product we could. 
 
Some notable achievements I have made during the course of the games development so far are:
* Developed a theme & create an (incomplete) soundtrack to compliment the games main theme 
* Learned how to use timers as well as element objects within SwiftUI to update 
* Learned how to impliment views to help organize my code
* Learned how to develop a basic UI 

Other features are still in development, such as:
* Ability to store data persistantly 
* Add points for time app is not running 
* Implimenting UI elements and assets 
* Adding a story with interactive elements based upon the gameplay
